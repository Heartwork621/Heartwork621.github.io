*As a medical student*
---------
I'm a forth year undergraduate medical student from [School of Medicine](https://szmed.sysu.edu.cn/zh-hans), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). I am currently learning at [Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.gzsys.org.cn/).

I am very fortune to have previously learnt at [Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center](https://www.gzzoc.com/), where the excellent faculty and world-class medical standards left a deep impression on me. Since high school, I have wanted to become a surgeon, and my experience at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center has further ignited my passion for ophthalmic surgery.
