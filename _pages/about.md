I'm a fourth year undergraduate medical student from [School of Medicine](https://szmed.sysu.edu.cn/zh-hans), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). I am currently learning at [Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital](https://www.gzsys.org.cn/). My current GPA is 3.81/5.00, ranking in the top 4% of the grade. Now, I am self-learning R programming and bioinformatics analysis. 

I am very fortunate to have previously learnt at [Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center](https://www.gzzoc.com/), where the excellent faculty and world-class medical standards left a deep impression on me. 

Since high school, I have wanted to become a surgeon, and my experience at Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center has further ignited my passion for ophthalmic surgery.

*As a guitarist*
------
After entering university, I taught myself to play the electric guitar. Music has become an integral part of my life. 

Here's a photo of my lovely guitar.

By the way, I am working hard to reach a speed of 200 BPM with sixteenth notes :D
