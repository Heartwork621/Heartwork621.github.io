I'm a fourth-year undergraduate medical student at [School of Medicine](https://szmed.sysu.edu.cn/zh-hans), [Sun Yat-sen University](https://www.sysu.edu.cn/). I am currently training at [Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital](https://www.gzsys.org.cn/). My current GPA is 3.81/5.00, ranking in the top 5%(16/406) of the grade. 

During my undergraduate studies, I have gained experience in the following molecular experimental techniques: Western Blot, plasmid amplification, and plasmid extraction.

I am currently teaching myself R programming and bioinformatics analysis. 

Here are some images I reproduced using R language (*left*).

*My hobby*
------
After entering university, I taught myself to play the electric guitar. Music has become an integral part of my life. 

Here's a photo of my lovely guitar.

By the way, I am working hard to reach a speed of 200 BPM with sixteenth notes :D
